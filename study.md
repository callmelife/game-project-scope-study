-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
  - Completed a few different versions of it. Settled on the final.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
  - I intend on using nested arrays in order to structure the data. Originally,
    I thought using an object would be the best route but I decided against it
    to keep things simple.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  - I intend on using an array in order to make and manipulate the board.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
  - I intend on tackling the HTML section first, then the CSS, then making sure the API aspect
  is done, then the game logic in JS. I'm going to have the hardest time with the
  JS so I want to get everything else out of the way first.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
  - As a user, I want to be able to understand the page without any instructions.
  - As a developer, I want to keep the code very modular so that I can track my code easily.
  - As a developer, I want to be able to accurately timebox myself so that I can make sure I get the project done.
  - As a developer, I want the functionality of the application to be intuitive. 
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
  - I intend on breaking files out by specific purpose. I will hopefully be able
  keep track of each aspect of the game easily by having a different file represent different things.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
  - I'll add creativity after the game is working well. Mostly focusing on page design, maybe link to additional pages like "how to play" and "history of the game"
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
  - Github for sure, its out best friend. Commit early and often.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
  - I will attempt bonuses after the project itself has been completed.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
